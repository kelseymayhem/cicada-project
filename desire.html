   <h1>desire</h1> 
   <br>
   <br>
    <p>
    once upon a time <br>
    there were not enough hours in the day <br>
    to get lost in your eyes <br>
    say to you the things <br>
    that all lovers say <br>
    i was so happy to do <br>
    anything <br> 
    that love wanted me to <br>
    if it meant I could be with you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    look at me now
    look at me now<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    love can make the air around you sing <br>
    love can walk through a wall of fire <br>
    love can do just about anything <br>
    but love can't live without desire <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    now when we're together <br>
    i find myself just watching the time <br>
    wishing I was somewhere else <br>
    wishing that you were never mine <br>
    i don't really want to do <br>
    even one thing <br>
    that love wants me to <br>
    i'm sorry baby <br> 
    but it's true <br>
    <p>
    look at me now
    look at me now<br>
    </p>
 <p>
    love can make the air around you sing <br>
    love can walk through a wall of fire <br>
    love can do just about anything <br>
    but love can't live without desire <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    oh baby it's crazy <br>
    how from nothing <br>
    love comes to be <br>
    but honey it's just as funny <br>
    that love turns to apathy <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    now when we're together <br>
    i find myself just watching the time <br>
    wishing i was somewhere else <br>
    wishing that you were never mine <br>
    i don't really want to do <br>
    even one thing <br>
    that love wants me to <br>
    i'm sorry baby <br>
    but it's true <br>
    </p>
   <p>look at me now</p> 
   <p>look at us...</p>
