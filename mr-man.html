 <h1>mr. man</h1>   
 <br>
 <br>
    <p>
    c'mere baby <br>
    tell mama what's wrong <br>
    it must be a terrible burden <br>
    to always have to be so strong <br>
    i'm gonna fix that <br>
    i'll hold your hardness for ransom <br>
    if that's too complicated to comprehend <br>
    call me Delilah <br>
    and answer to Samson <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    c'mere <br>
    shut up <br>
    stand there <br>
    and look pretty <br>
    mr. man, you're gonna be my kitty <br>
    oh you're trembling now <br>
    but I don't feel no pity <br>
    c'mere <br>
    shut up <br>
    stand there <br>
    and look pretty <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    i know it's hard <br>
    to let a woman make up your mind <br>
    but if you put yourself in my hands baby <br>
    i'll be gentle <br>
    i'll be kind <br>
    some men are sweet <br>
    they always do the things <br>
    that they should <br>
    but not you baby <br>
    no way <br>
    no how <br>
    you need just a little help <br>
    to be good <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    c'mere <br>
    shut up <br>
    stand there <br>
    and look pretty <br>
    mr. man, you're gonna be my kitty <br>
    oh you're trembling now <br>
    but I don't feel no pity <br>
    c'mere <br>
    shut up <br>
    stand there <br>
    and look pretty <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    sometimes you're sweet <br>
    you make it easy to be kind <br>
    you do the things I want you to <br>
    baby you tow the line <br>
    sometimes you're bad <br>
    you got a head like wood <br>
    listen up baby <br>
    sometimes <br>
    you need just a little hell <br>
    to be good <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    c'mere <br>
    shut up <br>
    stand there <br>
    and look pretty <br>
    mr. man, you're gonna be my kitty <br>
    oh you're trembling now <br>
