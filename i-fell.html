  <h1>i fell</h1>  
    <p>
    what if I told you <br>
    that I started something <br>
    and it didn't turn out okay <br>
    i pointed everything <br>
    in one direction <br>
    and it went the opposite way <br>
    what if I told you <br>
    that I was on fire <br>
    alive and looking for proof <br>
    and when all the facets were laid out before me <br>
    i ran away from the truth <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    when I thought my eyes were open <br>
    thought I was doing so well <br>
    thought I would always be standing <br>
    that's when I fell <br>
    baby I fell <br>
    baby I fell <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    i hope I've learned <br>
    when I think it's forever <br>
    it will not last through the day <br>
    and I know by now <br>
    when I cannot stop talking <br>
    i've really nothing to say <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    when I thought my eyes were open <br>
    thought I was doing so well <br>
    thought I would always be standing <br>
    that's when I fell <br>
    baby I fell <br>
    baby I fell <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    what if I told you <br>
    that I started something <br>
    and it didn't turn out okay <br>
    i pointed everything <br>
    in one direction <br>
    and it went the opposite way... <br>
