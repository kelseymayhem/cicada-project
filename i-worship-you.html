    <p>
    good god <br>
    holy moly <br>
    i guess i had a lot to say <br>
    listen here my little homie <br>
    don't look at me that-a way <br>
    we gotta drop this like a hot potato <br>
    why we wanna raise the dead? <br>
    i know i meant it when i said it <br>
    but it was only real in my head <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    you deserve <br>
    a standing ovation <br>
    for everything <br>
    i put you through <br>
    but the real real <br>
    about the situation is <br>
    i worship you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    lookie here <br>
    gosh a'mighty <br>
    i got myself so turned around <br>
    i better pick it up <br>
    and put it righty <br>
    plant myself on solid ground <br>
    well c'mon baby <br>
    we gotta stop the chatter <br>
    i know it didn't go so well <br>
    we only got one thing here <br>
    that's the matter <br>
    you are heaven <br>
    i'm a little hell <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    you deserve <br>
    a standing ovation <br>
    for everything <br>
    i put you through <br>
    but the real real <br>
    about this situation is <br>
    i worship you... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    we only got one thing here <br>
    that's the matter <br>
    you are heaven <br>
    i'm a little hell... <br>
