  <h1>girl like her</h1>  
  <br>
  <br>
    <p>
    other women disappear <br>
    when she walks into the room <br>
    to him she looks like a cookie <br>
    a milk-soaked lorna doone <br>
    other women talk him up <br>
    but he don't care to listen <br>
    he say her hips pump <br>
    like two glass beads in a piston <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    he says <br>
    nothing in this world is sure <br>
    but I will never <br>
    meet another girl like her <br>
    he says that <br>
    her sweet love is red and pure <br>
    and I will never meet another <br>
    girl like her <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    no paper education <br>
    can replace experience <br>
    no deed, no thought, no word <br>
    could make her lower her defense <br>
    he told her lots of stars have fallen <br>
    but they still forgive the moon <br>
    she say all your good intention <br>
    it's my road to ruin <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    he says <br>
    nothing in this world is sure <br>
    but I will never meet another girl like her <br>
    he says her sweet love is red and pure <br>
    and I will never <br>
    meet another girl like her <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    i see you're afraid <br>
    and that's ok <br>
    i'll be brave enough for us both <br>
    if you just stay <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    he says <br>
    nothing in this world is sure <br>
    but I will never meet another girl like her <br>
    he says that her sweet love is red and pure <br>
    and I will never <br>
    meet another girl like her <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    he says that her sweet love is red and pure <br>
    and I will never <br>
    meet another girl like her <br>
