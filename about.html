<p> Just like children everywhere, we were careless with our wild, beautiful, perfect youth. So on fire with everything that
the magic we made became little more than coins left in a forgotten pocket. When we stepped apart, I don't think either
of us realized that something irreplaceable was missing. <br><br>

I guess if you're lucky to live long enough, even old, careless children can still find undeserved grace- and so we
found ourselves together again. We had so much to tell each other and yet the time we spent seemed quiet. Our exchange
was this- the music you are listening to. We met in our secret place and spoke only in our secret language. Every moment
that passed between us lives in this work. <br><br>

This music is the fruit of our intimate and unfettered creative conversation. <br><br>

Thank you for listening. Thank you for letting us share. It's as honest as we can be. </p>
