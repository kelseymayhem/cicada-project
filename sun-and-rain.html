    now I don't know <br>
    if I ever really knew you <br>
    watching me go <br>
    seems to mean nothing to you <br>
    tell me I'm wrong <br>
    tell me that your heart <br> 
    beats true <br>
    or tell me I'm right <br>
    love was just my point of view <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    sun and rain <br>
    loss and gain <br>
    it's so different now <br>
    than the way that used to be <br>
    between you <br>
    and me <br>
    </p></span>

    i stole your eyes <br>
    to see the way you see me <br>
    surprise surprise <br>
    the truth cut <br>
    but did not kill me <br>
    you were just a stone <br>
    trying so hard <br>
    not to bleed <br>
    i was just a girl <br>
    who confused her want <br>
    with need <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    sun and rain <br>

    between you <br>
    and me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    it's like sun and rain <br>
    loss and gain <br>
    it's so different now <br>
