  <h1>SUN AND RAIN</h1>  
    <p>
    Now I don't know <br>
    If I ever really knew you <br>
    Watching me go <br>
    Seems to mean nothing to you <br>
    Tell me I'm wrong <br>
    Tell me that your heart beats true <br>
    Or tell me I'm right <br>
    Love was just my point of view <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It's like sun and rain <br>
    Loss and gain <br>
    It's so different now <br>
    Than the way that used to be <br>
    Between you <br>
    And me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I stole your eyes <br>
    To see the way you see me <br>
    Surprise surprise <br>
    The truth cut <br>
    But did not kill me <br>
    You were just a stone <br>
    Trying so hard <br>
    Not to bleed <br>
    I was just a girl <br>
    Who confused her want <br>
    With need <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It's like sun and rain <br>
    Loss and gain <br>
    It's so different now <br>
    Than the way that used to be <br>
    Between you <br>
    And me <br>
    </p>
