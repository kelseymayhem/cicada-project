    EVEN IF
    
    Everything fell apart
    I cried all day
    Not that tears can change a thing
    Anyway
    We're all in pieces now
    What do I do?
    But remember all the times
    I found my comfort in you
    
    Even if it's the end
    Even if everything's over
    I'll hold this moment
    Like a pearl...
    
    We put our hearts inside
    A golden ring
    Now it doesn't mean much
    Of anything...
    Whatever we once had
    Is what used to be
    Just remember all the times
    You found your comfort
    In me
    
    Even if it's the end
    Even if everything's over
    Just hold this moment
    Like a pearl
    Even if it's the end
    Even if the party's over
    It's just a moment
    In the world
    
    Even if it's the end
    Even if everything's over
    Let's hold this moment
    Like a pearl
    Even if it's the end
    Even if the party's over
    It's just a moment
    To the world
    
    Tomorrow might be ash
    But that's okay
    We only ever really get right now
    Anyway
    We cannot turn back time
    Or break the dawn
    We can only ever walk
    The road we are on
    
    We can only ever walk
    The road we are on...
