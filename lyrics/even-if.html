  <h1>EVEN IF</h1>  
    <p>
    Everything fell apart <br>
    I cried all day <br>
    Not that tears can change a thing <br>
    Anyway <br>
    We're all in pieces now <br>
    What do I do? <br>
    But remember all the times <br>
    I found my comfort in you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Even if it's the end <br>
    Even if everything's over <br>
    I'll hold this moment <br>
    Like a pearl... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    We put our hearts inside <br>
    A golden ring <br>
    Now it doesn't mean much <br>
    Of anything... <br>
    Whatever we once had <br>
    Is what used to be <br>
    Just remember all the times <br>
    You found your comfort <br>
    In me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Even if it's the end <br>
    Even if everything's over <br>
    Just hold this moment <br>
    Like a pearl <br>
    Even if it's the end <br>
    Even if the party's over <br>
    It's just a moment <br>
    In the world <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    Even if it's the end <br>
    Even if everything's over <br>
    Let's hold this moment <br>
    Like a pearl <br>
    Even if it's the end <br>
    Even if the party's over <br>
    It's just a moment <br>
    To the world <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Tomorrow might be ash <br>
    But that's okay <br>
    We only ever really get right now <br>
    Anyway <br>
    We cannot turn back time <br>
    Or break the dawn <br>
    We can only ever walk <br>
    The road we are on <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    We can only ever walk <br>
    The road we are on... <br>
