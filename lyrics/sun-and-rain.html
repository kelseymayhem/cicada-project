    SUN AND RAIN
    
    Now I don't know
    If I ever really knew you
    Watching me go
    Seems to mean nothing to you
    Tell me I'm wrong
    Tell me that your heart beats true
    Or tell me I'm right
    Love was just my point of view
    
    It's like sun and rain
    Loss and gain
    It's so different now
    Than the way that used to be
    Between you
    And me
    
    I stole your eyes
    To see the way you see me
    Surprise surprise
    The truth cut
    But did not kill me
    You were just a stone
    Trying so hard
    Not to bleed
    I was just a girl
    Who confused her want
    With need
    
    It's like sun and rain
    Loss and gain
    It's so different now
    Than the way that used to be
    Between you
    And me
    
    You were just a stone
    Trying so hard
    Not to bleed
    I was just a girl
    Who confused her want
    With need
    
    It's like sun and rain
    Loss and gain
    It's so different now
    Than the way that used to be
    Between you
    And me
    
    Between you
    And me
