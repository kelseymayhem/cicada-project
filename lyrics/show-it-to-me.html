    SHOW IT TO ME
    
    What's a matter little one
    Hey gimme your hand
    No air all around
    I think I understand
    What's a matter precious one
    What don't you want me to see
    C'mon turn around
    Show it to me
    
    Is it near
    Is it far
    Is it new
    Or a scar
    Is it a worry
    Is it sharp
    Is it hot
    Is it fierce
    Is it not
    Is it a worry
    
    Aw yeah show it to me
    C'mon show it to me
    
    Now you look a little lost
    But honey don't be shy
    When you open up
    It looks like a lullaby
    I know you're wondering how I know
    Hey once I felt that way too
    But I lost my fear
    When I showed it to you
    
    Is it near
    Is it far
    Is it new
    Or a scar
    Is it a worry
    Is it sharp
    Is it hot
    Is it fierce
    Is it not
    Is it a worry
    
    Oh yeah show it to me
    
    C'mon show it to me
    
    Hey, gimme your hand...
    
    I know that you feel all alone
    And right now lost at sea
    But the truth is you're already home
    Just anchor beside me
    
    Aw show it to me
    Ya show it to me
    
    Is it near
    Is it far
    Is it new
    Or a scar
    Is it a worry
    Is it sharp
    Is it hot
    Is it fierce
    Is it not
    Is it a worry
