    I FEEL BEAUTIFUL
    
    Baby you can bask in love
    Or roll in dough
    So you better be careful
    About all the seeds you sew
    For the day will come
    When your youth will go
    You better let the outside change
    So the inside can grow
    
    A little time only deepens your root
    A little longer on the vine
    Only sweetens your fruit
    
    Take my vanity
    Oh that's fine
    Draw the years on my face
    Line by line
    Cause the longer I live
    The deeper I shine
    I feel beautiful
    For the 1st time
    
    Well, the point as far as I can see
    Is for you to get to know you
    And me to know me
    And the best part of your life
    Don't belong to your youth
    As the years go by
    You'll learn that's the truth
    
    A little time only deepens your root
    A little longer on the vine
    Only sweetens your fruit
    
    Take my vanity
    Oh that's fine
    Draw the years on my face
    Line by line
    Cause the longer I live
    The deeper I shine
    I feel beautiful
    For the 1st time
    
    For the first time I feel...
    For the first time I feel...
    For the first time I feel...
    
    Beautiful
    
    Baby you can bask in love
    Or roll in dough
    So you better be careful
    About all the seeds you sew
    For the day will come
    When your youth will go
    You better let the outside grey
    So the inside can grow
    
    For the first time you'll beautiful...
