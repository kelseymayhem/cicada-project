    I FELL
    
    What if I told you
    That I started something
    And it didn't turn out okay
    I pointed everything
    In one direction
    And it went the opposite way
    
    What if I told you
    That I was on fire
    Alive and looking for proof
    And when all the facets were
    Laid out before me
    I ran away from the truth
    
    When I thought my eyes were open
    Thought I was doing so well
    Thought I would always be standing
    That's when I fell
    Baby I fell
    Baby I fell
    
    I hope I've learned
    When I think it's forever
    It will not last through the day
    And I know by now
    When I cannot stop talking
    I've really nothing to say
    
    When I thought my eyes were open
    Thought I was doing so well
    Thought I would always be standing
    That's when I fell
    Baby I fell
    Baby I fell
    
    What if I told you
    That I started something
    And it didn't turn out okay
    I pointed everything
    In one direction
    And it went the opposite way
