  <h1>I FELL</h1>  
    <p>
    What if I told you <br>
    That I started something <br>
    And it didn't turn out okay <br>
    I pointed everything <br>
    In one direction <br>
    And it went the opposite way <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    What if I told you <br>
    That I was on fire <br>
    Alive and looking for proof <br>
    And when all the facets were <br>
    Laid out before me <br>
    I ran away from the truth <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    When I thought my eyes were open <br>
    Thought I was doing so well <br>
    Thought I would always be standing <br>
    That's when I fell <br>
    Baby I fell <br>
    Baby I fell <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I hope I've learned <br>
    When I think it's forever <br>
    It will not last through the day <br>
    And I know by now <br>
    When I cannot stop talking <br>
    I've really nothing to say <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    When I thought my eyes were open <br>
    Thought I was doing so well <br>
    Thought I would always be standing <br>
    That's when I fell <br>
    Baby I fell <br>
    Baby I fell <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    What if I told you <br>
    That I started something <br>
    And it didn't turn out okay <br>
    I pointed everything <br>
    In one direction <br>
    And it went the opposite way <br>
