    DIAMOND TIME
    
    Some say the end-all
    Is silver & gold
    I say keep your cash
    Cash is too cold
    I'll take your kisses over hard currency
    Dying in your arms
    Would be death by luxury
    
    I save up my sweetness
    And give it all to you
    
    Diamond time
    Here we come
    Ruby red
    Sapphire blue
    If love were riches
    We would rule
    Your company is a jewel...
    
    Diamond time
    Here we come
    Ruby red
    Sapphire blue
    If love were riches
    We would rule
    Your company is a jewel...
    
    Having your love
    Is having it all
    I don't need to watch
    No market rise and fall
    Add up the riches
    & treasures on earth
    x10 is about 1/2
    Of what you're worth
    
    I save up my sweetness
    And give it all to you
    
    Diamond time
    Here we come
    Ruby red
    Sapphire blue
    If love were riches
    We would rule
    Your company is a jewel...
    
    Diamond time
    Here we come
    Ruby red
    Sapphire blue
    If love were riches
    We would rule
    Your company is a jewel...
    
    As far as I'm concerned
    Too much is not too much
    I'm holding out
    For your million $ touch
    
    Diamond time
    Here we come
    Ruby red
    Sapphire blue
    If love were riches
    We would rule
    Your company is a jewel...
    
    Diamond time
    Here we come
    Ruby red
    Sapphire blue
    If love were riches
    We would rule
    Your company is a jewel...
