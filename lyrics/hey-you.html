    HEY YOU
    
    Theories abound
    'Bout how she ever wound up
    In this one horse town
    But she rules the cafe
    With her over-easy smile
    & her coffee sashay
    
    All the local fall
    When she says
    Hey you
    Hey you
    Gimme your cup
    I'm gonna fill it up
    With ecstasy
    But you better keep you place
    Don't ever say
    'Hey...'
    To me
    
    All bets are in
    Buckle up
    Because the game's
    About to begin
    He fills the door
    1/2 a heartbeat later
    She uses him
    To mop the floor
    
    The boys try anyway
    Hey baby
    Can't we just this once
    Carpe Diem
    No Regrets
    S'il vous plait?
    
    All the local fall
    When she says
    Hey you
    Hey you
    Gimme your cup
    I'm gonna fill it up
    With ecstasy
    But you better keep you place
    Don't ever say
    'Hey...'
    To me
    
    You better keep your place
    Don't ever never ever say
    'Hey...'
    To me
