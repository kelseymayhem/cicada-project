   <h1>HEY YOU</h1> 
    <p>
    Theories abound <br>
    'Bout how she ever wound up <br>
    In this one horse town <br>
    But she rules the cafe <br>
    With her over-easy smile <br>
    & her coffee sashay <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    All the local fall <br>
    When she says <br>
    Hey you <br>
    Hey you <br>
    Gimme your cup <br>
    I'm gonna fill it up <br>
    With ecstasy <br>
    But you better keep you place <br>
    Don't ever say <br>
    'Hey...' <br>
    To me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    All bets are in <br>
    Buckle up <br>
    Because the game's <br>
    About to begin <br>
    He fills the door <br>
    1/2 a heartbeat later <br>
    She uses him <br>
    To mop the floor <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    The boys try anyway <br>
    Hey baby <br>
    Can't we just this once <br>
    Carpe Diem <br>
    No Regrets <br>
    S'il vous plait? <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    All the local fall <br>
    When she says <br>
    Hey you <br>
    Hey you <br>
    Gimme your cup <br>
    I'm gonna fill it up <br>
    With ecstasy <br>
    But you better keep you place <br>
    Don't ever say <br>
    'Hey...' <br>
    To me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    You better keep your place <br>
    Don't ever never ever say <br>
    'Hey...' <br>
    To me <br>
