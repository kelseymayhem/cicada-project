    GIRL LIKE HER
    
    Other women disappear
    When she walks into the room
    To him she looks like a cookie
    A milk-soaked Lorna Doone
    Other women talk him up
    But he don't care to listen
    He say her hips pump
    Like two glass beads in a piston
    
    He says
    Nothing in this world is sure
    But I will never
    Meet another girl like her
    He says
    Her sweet love
    Is red and pure
    And I will never meet another
    Girl like her
    
    No paper education
    Can replace experience
    No deed, no thought, no word
    Could make her
    Lower her defense
    He told her lots of stars have fallen
    But they still forgive the moon
    She say all your good intentions-
    It's my road to ruin
    
    He says
    Nothing in this world is sure
    But I will never
    Meet another girl like her
    He says
    Her sweet love
    Is red and pure
    And I will never meet another
    Girl like her
    
    I can see you're afraid
    Baby, that's ok
    I'll be brave enough
    For us both
    If you
    Just stay
    
    He says
    Nothing in this world is sure
    But I will never
    Meet another girl like her
    He says
    Her sweet love
    Is red and pure
    And I will never meet another
    Girl like her
