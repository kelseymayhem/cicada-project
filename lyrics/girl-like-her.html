  <h1>GIRL LIKE HER</h1>  
    <p>
    Other women disappear <br>
    When she walks into the room <br>
    To him she looks like a cookie <br>
    A milk-soaked Lorna Doone <br>
    Other women talk him up <br>
    But he don't care to listen <br>
    He say her hips pump <br>
    Like two glass beads in a piston <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    He says <br>
    Nothing in this world is sure <br>
    But I will never <br>
    Meet another girl like her <br>
    He says <br>
    Her sweet love <br>
    Is red and pure <br>
    And I will never meet another <br>
    Girl like her <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    No paper education <br>
    Can replace experience <br>
    No deed, no thought, no word <br>
    Could make her <br>
    Lower her defense <br>
    He told her lots of stars have fallen <br>
    But they still forgive the moon <br>
    She say all your good intentions- <br>
    It's my road to ruin <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    He says <br>
    Nothing in this world is sure <br>
    But I will never <br>
    Meet another girl like her <br>
    He says <br>
    Her sweet love <br>
    Is red and pure <br>
    And I will never meet another <br>
    Girl like her <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I can see you're afraid <br>
    Baby, that's ok <br>
    I'll be brave enough <br>
    For us both <br>
    If you <br>
    Just stay <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    He says <br>
    Nothing in this world is sure <br>
    But I will never <br>
    Meet another girl like her <br>
    He says <br>
    Her sweet love <br>
    Is red and pure <br>
    And I will never meet another <br>
    Girl like her <br>
