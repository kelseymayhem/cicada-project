    MR. MAN
    
    C'mere baby
    Tell mama what's wrong
    It must be a terrible burden
    To always have to be so strong
    I'm gonna fix that
    I'll hold your hardness for ransom
    If that's too complicated to comprehend
    Call me Delilah
    And answer to Samson
    
    C'mere
    Shut up
    Stand there
    And look pretty
    Mr. Man
    You're gonna be my kitty
    Oh you're trembling now
    But I don't feel no pity
    C'mere
    Shut up
    Stand there
    And look pretty
    
    I know it's hard
    To let a woman make up your mind
    But if you put yourself in my hands baby
    I'll be gentle
    I'll be kind
    Some men are sweet
    They always do the things
    That they should
    But not you baby
    No way no how
    You need just a little help
    To be good
    
    So c'mere
    Shut up
    Stand there
    And look pretty
    Mr. Man
    You're gonna be my kitty
    Oh you're trembling now
    But I don't feel no pity
    C'mere
    Shut up
    Stand there
    And look pretty
    
    Sometimes you're sweet
    You make it easy to be kind
    You do the things I want you to
    Baby you tow the line
    Sometimes you're bad
    You got a head like wood
    Listen up baby
    Sometimes
    You need just a little hell
    To be good
    
    So c'mere
    Shut up
    Stand there
    And look pretty
    Mr. Man
    You're gonna be my kitty
    Oh you're trembling now
    But I don't feel no pity
    C'mere
    Shut up
    Stand there
    And look pretty
