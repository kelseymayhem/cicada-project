   <h1>DON'T YOU KNOW</h1> 
    <p>
    You got it wrong <br>
    Baby you did not think it through <br>
    How could you forget <br>
    That my heart's <br>
    The truest blue? <br>
    Why are you crying <br>
    Like you're all alone <br>
    While I'm waiting out here <br>
    In the world? <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Soon as my heart hears your call <br>
    My love takes a leap <br>
    Not fall <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Don't u know <br>
    Everything will be okay? <br>
    Not 'cause I say so <br>
    But tomorrow <br>
    Is another day... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    It looks so dark <br>
    'Cause inside the moment <br>
    We're all blind <br>
    We can only see <br>
    Once we walk ahead <br>
    And look behind <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    We are crying <br>
    Like we're all alone <br>
    But we are all together <br>
    In the world <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    As soon as hearts hear a call <br>
    All love takes a leap <br>
    Not fall <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Don't u know <br>
    Everything will be okay? <br>
    Not 'cause I say so <br>
    But tomorrow <br>
    Is another day... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Why are you crying? <br>
    You are not alone <br>
    Not as long as I am <br>
    In the world <br>
    Whenever my heart <br>
    Hears your call <br>
    My love makes a leap <br>
    Not fall <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    We're together <br>
    Forever... <br>
    </p>
