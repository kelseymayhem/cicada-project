    DON'T YOU KNOW
    
    You got it wrong
    Baby you did not think it through
    How could you forget
    That my heart's
    The truest blue?
    Why are you crying
    Like you're all alone
    While I'm waiting out here
    In the world?
    
    Soon as my heart hears your call
    My love takes a leap
    Not fall
    
    Don't u know
    Everything will be okay?
    Not 'cause I say so
    But tomorrow
    Is another day...
    
    It looks so dark
    'Cause inside the moment
    We're all blind
    We can only see
    Once we walk ahead
    And look behind
    
    We are crying
    Like we're all alone
    But we are all together
    In the world
    
    As soon as hearts hear a call
    All love takes a leap
    Not fall
    
    Don't u know
    Everything will be okay?
    Not 'cause I say so
    But tomorrow
    Is another day...
    
    Why are you crying?
    You are not alone
    Not as long as I am
    In the world
    Whenever my heart
    Hears your call
    My love makes a leap
    Not fall
    
    We're together
    Forever...
