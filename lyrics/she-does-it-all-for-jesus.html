    SHE DOES IT ALL FOR JESUS
    
    It looks like she isn't feeling well
    It clings to her like steam
    I suppose the devil's here from Hell
    That's why she sits in a puddle of cream
    
    She does it all for Jesus
    Says so on the bumper of her car
    Does it all for Glory
    Hoping it sticks like tar
    Shouting Hallelujah
    Though she don't know what it means
    She does it all for Jesus
    
    Temptation wants her to participate
    But she prays instead
    She's so sure that love
    Can conquer hate
    That's why she wants
    The devil in her bed
    
    She does it all for Jesus
    Says so on the bumper of her car
    Does it all for Glory
    Hoping it sticks like tar
    Shouting Hallelujah though
    She don't know what it means
    She does it all for Jesus
    
    Her Devotion is at a restaurant
    Tasting all the dishes
    Her Devotion is trying on a hat
    Baby better not confuse those prayers
    With wishes
    
    She does it all for Jesus
    Says so on the bumper of her car
    Does it all for Glory
    Hoping it sticks like tar
    Shouting Hallelujah
    Though she don't know what it means
    She does it all for Jesus
