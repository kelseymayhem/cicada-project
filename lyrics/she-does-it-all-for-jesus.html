   <h1>SHE DOES IT ALL FOR JESUS</h1> 
    <p>
    It looks like she isn't feeling well <br>
    It clings to her like steam <br>
    I suppose the devil's here from Hell <br>
    That's why she sits in a puddle of cream <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    She does it all for Jesus <br>
    Says so on the bumper of her car <br>
    Does it all for Glory <br>
    Hoping it sticks like tar <br>
    Shouting Hallelujah <br>
    Though she don't know what it means <br>
    She does it all for Jesus <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Temptation wants her to participate <br>
    But she prays instead <br>
    She's so sure that love <br>
    Can conquer hate <br>
    That's why she wants <br>
    The devil in her bed <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    She does it all for Jesus <br>
    Says so on the bumper of her car <br>
    Does it all for Glory <br>
    Hoping it sticks like tar <br>
    Shouting Hallelujah though <br>
    She don't know what it means <br>
    She does it all for Jesus <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Her Devotion is at a restaurant <br>
    Tasting all the dishes <br>
    Her Devotion is trying on a hat <br>
    Baby better not confuse those prayers <br>
    With wishes <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    She does it all for Jesus <br>
    Says so on the bumper of her car <br>
    Does it all for Glory <br>
    Hoping it sticks like tar <br>
    Shouting Hallelujah <br>
    Though she don't know what it means <br>
    She does it all for Jesus <br>
