    SO HARD
    
    Ketamine in pocket
    Over-inflated lips
    Sycophantic fawning
    Upon your breastages and hips
    Your auntie was a movie star
    She got murdered just the same
    Now every inch of your skin
    Describes every ounce of pain
    
    Girl
    You look so hard
    On the outside...
    
    Sweetest Sugar Baby but
    I seen you turn that shit on a dime
    & you were talking to yourself
    When you told him it's the last time
    Last time
    Last time...
    He knew you had a heart of glass
    Still he cut you to the bone
    Maybe when you're dead
    They'll finally leave you alone
    
    Girl
    You look so hard
    On the outside...
    
    You said everything is dirt
    Nothing in this world is for me
    Look at all the parts
    Where all I ever get is misery
    I ain't gonna say you're wrong
    But I ain't gonna say it's true
    All I know is when I look into you
    You're only hard
    On the outside...
