    I WORSHIP YOU
    
    Good God
    Holy Moly
    I guess I had a lot to say
    Listen here my little homie
    Don't look at me that-a way
    We gotta drop this like a hot potato
    Why we wanna raise the dead?
    I know I meant it when I said it
    But it was only real in my head
    
    You deserve
    A standing ovation
    For everything
    I put you through
    But the Real Real
    About this situation is
    I worship you
    
    Lookie here
    Gosh a'mighty
    I got myself so turned around
    I better pick it up
    And put it righty
    Plant myself on solid ground
    Well c'mon baby
    We gotta stop the chatter
    I know it didn't go so well
    We only got one thing here
    That's the matter
    You are Heaven
    I'm a little hell...
    
    You deserve
    A standing ovation
    For everything
    I put you through
    But the Real Real
    About this situation is
    I worship you...
    
    We only got one thing here
    That's the matter
    You are Heaven
    I'm a little hell...
