   <h1>I WORSHIP YOU</h1> 
    <p>
    Good God <br>
    Holy Moly <br>
    I guess I had a lot to say <br>
    Listen here my little homie <br>
    Don't look at me that-a way <br>
    We gotta drop this like a hot potato <br>
    Why we wanna raise the dead? <br>
    I know I meant it when I said it <br>
    But it was only real in my head <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    You deserve <br>
    A standing ovation <br>
    For everything <br>
    I put you through <br>
    But the Real Real <br>
    About this situation is <br>
    I worship you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Lookie here <br>
    Gosh a'mighty <br>
    I got myself so turned around <br>
    I better pick it up <br>
    And put it righty <br>
    Plant myself on solid ground <br>
    Well c'mon baby <br>
    We gotta stop the chatter <br>
    I know it didn't go so well <br>
    We only got one thing here <br>
    That's the matter <br>
    You are Heaven <br>
    I'm a little hell... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    You deserve <br>
    A standing ovation <br>
    For everything <br>
    I put you through <br>
    But the Real Real <br>
    About this situation is <br>
    I worship you... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    We only got one thing here <br>
    That's the matter <br>
    You are Heaven <br>
    I'm a little hell... <br>
