   <h1>QUEEN</h1> 
    <p>
    The queen lives in my trailer park <br>
    Says I'm the only one who knows <br>
    She swore me to secrecy <br>
    Before she showed me the side of her nose <br>
    Pressed against a picture <br>
    In a greasy old magazine <br>
    I said it looked like proof <br>
    Though it was not the truth <br>
    I was just trying not to be mean <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Like a crucifix she carries <br>
    The weight of her royal gene <br>
    Like a pendulum she vacillates <br>
    Between truth and imagining <br>
    All I really know for sure <br>
    Is when she's drunk she's mean <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Baby my fate may not be great <br>
    But at least I'm not a queen <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    The queen lives in my trailer park <br>
    And she puts on airs a'plenty <br>
    Sips her drink with her pinky out <br>
    Even though it's Mad Dog 20/20 <br>
    A black hole in her mattress <br>
    Speaks of a long lost cigarette <br>
    When she offers a chair <br>
    I sit down right there <br>
    Even though I know <br>
    The seat will be wet <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    Like a crucifix she carries <br>
    The weight of her royal gene <br>
    Like a pendulum she vacillates <br>
    Between truth and imagining <br>
    All I really know for sure <br>
    Is when she's drunk she's mean <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    Baby my fate may not be great <br>
    But at least I'm not a queen <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    She says back when she was a princess <br>
    She used to look just like me <br>
    With long pretty hair <br>
    And curves there and there <br>
    And would I buy her some bourbon please? <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Like a crucifix she carries <br>
    The weight of her royal gene <br>
    Like a pendulum she vacillates <br>
    Between truth and imagining <br>
    All I really know for sure <br>
    Is when she's drunk she's mean <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Baby my fate may not be great <br>
    But at least I'm not a queen <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    At least I'm not a queen <br>
