    QUEEN
    
    The queen lives in my trailer park
    Says I'm the only one who knows
    She swore me to secrecy
    Before she showed me the side of her nose
    Pressed against a picture
    In a greasy old magazine
    I said it looked like proof
    Though it was not the truth
    I was just trying not to be mean
    
    Like a crucifix she carries
    The weight of her royal gene
    Like a pendulum she vacillates
    Between truth and imagining
    All I really know for sure
    Is when she's drunk she's mean
    
    Baby my fate may not be great
    But at least I'm not a queen
    
    The queen lives in my trailer park
    And she puts on airs a'plenty
    Sips her drink with her pinky out
    Even though it's Mad Dog 20/20
    A black hole in her mattress
    Speaks of a long lost cigarette
    When she offers a chair
    I sit down right there
    Even though I know
    The seat will be wet
    
    Like a crucifix she carries
    The weight of her royal gene
    Like a pendulum she vacillates
    Between truth and imagining
    All I really know for sure
    Is when she's drunk she's mean
    
    Baby my fate may not be great
    But at least I'm not a queen
    
    She says back when she was a princess
    She used to look just like me
    With long pretty hair
    And curves there and there
    And would I buy her some bourbon please?
    
    Like a crucifix she carries
    The weight of her royal gene
    Like a pendulum she vacillates
    Between truth and imagining
    All I really know for sure
    Is when she's drunk she's mean
    
    Baby my fate may not be great
    But at least I'm not a queen
    
    At least I'm not a queen
