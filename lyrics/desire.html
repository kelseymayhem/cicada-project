   <h1>DESIRE</h1> 
    <p>
    Once upon a time <br>
    There were not enough <br>
    Hours in the day <br>
    To get lost in your eyes <br>
    Say to you the things <br>
    That all lovers say <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I was so happy to do <br>
    Anything that love wanted me to <br>
    If it meant I could be with you <br>
    Look at me now... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Love can make the air around you sing <br>
    Love can walk through a wall of fire <br>
    Love can do just about anything but <br>
    Love can't live without desire <br>
    Desire... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Now when we're together <br>
    I find myself just watching the time <br>
    Wishing I was somewhere else <br>
    Wishing that you were never mine <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I don't really want to do <br>
    Even one thing that love wants me to <br>
    I'm sorry baby, but it's true <br>
    Look at me now <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Love can make the air around you sing <br>
    Love can walk through a wall of fire <br>
    Love can do just about anything but <br>
    Love can't live without desire <br>
    Desire... <br>
    </p> 
    <p>
    Oh baby <br>
    It's crazy <br>
    How from nothing <br>
    Love comes to be <br>
    But honey <br>
    It's just as funny <br>
    How love <br>
    Turns to apathy <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I don't really want to do <br>
    Even one thing that love wants me to <br>
    I'm sorry baby, but it's true <br>
    Look at me now <br>
    </p>
   <p>Look at us</p> 
    
   <p>Look at me now</p>
