    DESIRE
    
    Once upon a time
    There were not enough
    Hours in the day
    To get lost in your eyes
    Say to you the things
    That all lovers say
    
    I was so happy to do
    Anything that love wanted me to
    If it meant I could be with you
    Look at me now...
    
    Love can make the air around you sing
    Love can walk through a wall of fire
    Love can do just about anything but
    Love can't live without desire
    Desire...
    
    Now when we're together
    I find myself just watching the time
    Wishing I was somewhere else
    Wishing that you were never mine
    
    I don't really want to do
    Even one thing that love wants me to
    I'm sorry baby, but it's true
    Look at me now
    
    Love can make the air around you sing
    Love can walk through a wall of fire
    Love can do just about anything but
    Love can't live without desire
    Desire...
    
    Oh baby
    It's crazy
    How from nothing
    Love comes to be
    But honey
    It's just as funny
    How love
    Turns to apathy
    
    I don't really want to do
    Even one thing that love wants me to
    I'm sorry baby, but it's true
    Look at me now
    
    Look at us
    
    Look at me now
