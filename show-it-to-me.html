   <h1>SHOW IT TO ME </h1> <br>
    
    <p> What's a matter little one <br>
    Hey gimme your hand <br>
    No air all around <br>
    I think I understand <br>
    What's a matter precious one <br>
    What don't you want me to see <br>
    C'mon turn around <br>
    Show it to me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Is it near <br>
    Is it far <br>
    Is it new <br>
    Or a scar <br>
    Is it a worry <br>
    Is it sharp <br>
    Is it hot <br>
    Is it fierce <br>
    Is it not <br>
    Is it a worry <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Aw yeah show it to me <br>
    C'mon show it to me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Now you look a little lost <br>
    But honey don't be shy <br>
    When you open up <br>
    It looks like a lullaby <br>
    I know you're wondering how I know <br>
    Hey once I felt that way too <br>
    But I lost my fear <br>
    When I showed it to you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Is it near <br>
    Is it far <br>
    Is it new <br>
    Or a scar <br>
    Is it a worry <br>
    Is it sharp <br>
    Is it hot <br>
    Is it fierce <br>
    Is it not <br>
    Is it a worry <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Oh yeah show it to me <br>
    
    C'mon show it to me <br>
    
    Hey, gimme your hand... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I know that you feel all alone <br>
    And right now lost at sea <br>
    But the truth is you're already home <br>
    Just anchor beside me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Aw show it to me <br>
    Ya show it to me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Is it near <br>
    Is it far <br>
    Is it new <br>
    Or a scar <br>
    Is it a worry <br>
    Is it sharp <br>
    Is it hot <br>
    Is it fierce <br>
    Is it not <br>
    Is it a worry <br>
    </p>
