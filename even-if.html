  <h1>even if</h1>  
    <p>
    everything fell apart <br>
    i cried all day <br>
    not that tears can change a thing <br>
    anyway <br>
    we're all in pieces now <br>
    what do I do? <br>
    but remember all the times <br>
    i found my comfort <br>
    in you <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    even if it's the end <br>
    even if everything's over <br>
    i'll hold this moment like a pearl... <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    we put our hearts inside <br>
    a golden ring <br>
    now it doesn't mean much <br>
    of anything <br>
    whatever we once had <br>
    is what used to be <br>
    remember all the times <br>
    you found your comfort <br>
    in me <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    even if <br>
    it's the end <br>
    even if everything's over <br>
    just hold this moment <br>
    like a pearl <br>
    even if it's the end <br>
    even if the party's over <br>
    it's just a moment <br>
    in the world <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    even if it's the end <br>
    even if everything's over <br>
    let's hold this moment like a pearl <br>
    even if it's the end <br>
    even if the party's over <br>
    it's just a moment <br>
    to the world <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    tomorrow might be ash <br>
    but that's okay <br>
    we only ever really get right now <br>
    anyway <br>
    we cannot turn back time <br>
    or break the dawn <br>
    we can only ever walk <br>
    the road we are on <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    we can only ever walk <br>
    the road we are on... <br>
