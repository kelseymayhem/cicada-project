        <span class="pupa-bold">Pupa,</span> <span class="pupa-italic">plural pupae or pupas,</span>  life stage in the development of insects exhibiting complete metamorphosis that occurs
        between the larval and adult stages (imago). During pupation, larval structures break down, and adult structures such as
        wings appear for the first time. The adult emerges by either splitting the pupal skin, chewing its way out, or secreting
        a fluid that softens the silk cocoon (if present). The process of pupation is controlled by hormones. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Some of the most commonly recognized pupal stages are the chrysalis of butterflies and cocoon of moths (Lepidoptera). In
        this protective covering, the caterpillar is transformed into an adult. Chrysalides and cocoons may be found hanging
        from twigs or bushes, hidden in rolled leaves, in underground litter, or in burrows. Some insects spend the winter in
        the pupal stage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The pupa can be one of three forms: exarate, with the appendages not attached to the pupal skin; obtect, with the
        appendages attached to the pupal skin; or coarctate, where the pupa occurs within the shed exoskeleton of the last
        larval stage.</p>
