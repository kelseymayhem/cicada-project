  <h1>so hard</h1>  
  <br>
  <br>
    <p>
    ketamine in pocket <br>
    over-inflated lips <br>
    sycophantic fawning <br>
    upon your breastages and hips <br>
    your auntie was a movie star <br>
    she got murdered just the same <br>
    now every inch of your skin <br>
    describes every ounce of pain <br>
    girl <br>
    you look so hard <br>
    on the outside... <br>
    sweetest sugar baby  <br>
    but i seen you turn that shit on a dime <br>
    & you were talking to yourself <br>
    when you told him it's the last time <br>
    last time <br>
    last time... <br>
    he knew you had a heart of glass <br>
    still <br>
    he cut you to the bone <br>
    maybe when you're dead <br>
    they'll finally leave you alone <br>
    girl <br>
    you look so hard <br>
    on the outside... <br>
    you said everything is dirt <br>
    what about the world is for me <br>
    what about the part <br>
    where all i ever get is misery <br>
    i ain't gonna say you're wrong <br>
    but i ain't gonna say it's true <br>
    all i know is when I look into you <br>
    you're only hard <br>
    on the outside... <br>
