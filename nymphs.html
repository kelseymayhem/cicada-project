            <p>
        In biology, a nymph is the immature form of some invertebrates, particularly insects, which undergoes gradual
        metamorphosis (hemimetabolism) before reaching its adult stage.[1] Unlike a typical larva, a nymph's overall form
        already resembles that of the adult, except for a lack of wings (in winged species). In addition, while a nymph moults,
        it never enters a pupal stage. Instead, the final moult results in an adult insect.[2] Nymphs undergo multiple stages of
        development called instars. <br>
        
        This is the case, for example, in Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers and locusts), Hemiptera (cicadas, shield bugs,
        whiteflies, aphids, jassids, etc.), mayflies, termites, cockroaches, mantises, stoneflies and Odonata (dragonflies and
        damselflies).[3] <br>
        
        Nymphs of aquatic insects, as in the Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Plecoptera, are also called naiads, an Ancient Greek
        name for mythological water nymphs. Usage of the term 'naiad' is no longer popular among entomologists, who have come to
        see the distinction between nymph and larva as more of evolutionary grade than a clearly distinct life stage.[4] In
        older literature, these were sometimes referred to as the heterometabolous insects, as their adult and immature stages
        live in different environments (terrestrial vs. aquatic).[5] <br>
        
           <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/nymph-entomology">https://www.britannica.com/science/nymph-entomology</a> <br>
        
            Nymph, in entomology, sexually immature form usually similar to the adult and found in such insects as grasshoppers
            and cockroaches, which have incomplete, or hemimetabolic, metamorphosis (see metamorphosis). Wings, if present,
            develop from external wing buds after the first few molts. The body proportions of the first nymphal stages are
            quite different from those of the adult. During each successive growing stage (instar) the nymph begins to resemble
            the adult more closely.</p> <br>
