   <h1>she does it all for jesus</h1> 
    <p>
    it looks like she isn't feeling well <br>
    it clings to her like steam <br>
    i suppose the devil's here from hell <br>
    that's why she sits in a puddle of cream <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    she does it all for Jesus <br>
    says so on the bumper of her car <br>
    does it all for glory <br>
    hoping it sticks like tar <br>
    singing hallelujah <br>
    though she don't know what it means <br>
    she does it all for jesus <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    temptation wants her to participate <br>
    but she prays instead <br>
    she's so sure that love <br>
    can conquer hate <br>
    that's why she wants <br>
    the devil in her bed <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    she does it all for jesus <br>
    says so on the bumper of her car <br>
    does it all for glory <br>
    hoping it sticks like tar <br>
    singing hallelujah<br>
    though she don't know what it means <br>
    she does it all for jesus <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    her devotion is at a restaurant <br>
    tasting all the dishes <br>
    her devotion is trying on a hat <br>
    baby better not confuse those <br>
    prayers with wishes <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    she does it all for jesus <br>
    says so on the bumper of her car <br>
    does it all for glory <br>
    hoping it sticks like tar <br>
    singing hallelujah <br>
    though she don't know what it means <br>
    she does it all for jesus... <br>
