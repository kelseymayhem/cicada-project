   <h1>queen</h1> 
    <p>
    the queen lives in my trailer park <br>
    says I'm the only one who knows <br>
    she swore me to secrecy <br>
    before she showed me the side of her nose <br>
    pressed against a picture <br>
    in a greasy old magazine <br>
    i said it looked like proof <br>
    though it was not the truth <br>
    i was just trying not to be mean <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    like a crucifix she carries <br>
    the weight of her royal gene <br>
    like a pendulum she vacillates <br>
    between truth and imagining <br>
    all I really know for sure <br>
    is when she's drunk she's mean <br>
    baby my fate may not be great <br>
    but <br>
    at least I'm not a queen <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    the queen lives in my trailer park <br>
    and she puts on airs a'plenty <br>
    sips her drink with her pinky out <br>
    even though it's Mad Dog 20/20 <br>
    a black hole in her mattress <br>
    speaks of a long lost cigarette <br>
    when she offers a chair <br>
    i sit down right there <br>
    even though I know <br>
    the seat will be wet <br>
   </p> 
   <p>
    like a crucifix she carries <br>
    the weight of her royal gene <br>
    like a pendulum she vacillates <br>
    between truth and imagining <br>
    all I really know for sure <br>
    is when she's drunk she's mean <br>
    baby my fate may not be great <br>
    but <br>
    at least I'm not a queen <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    she says back when she was a princess <br>
    she used to look just like me <br>
    with long pretty hair <br>
    and curves there and there <br>
    and would I buy her some bourbon please? <br>
    </p>
